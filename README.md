Pointers to publicly available assembly, binning, and profiling results (with structured metadata).


## Step 1: Upload your results

## Step 2: Provide structured metadata

Metadata and links to the raw data are stored in this repository in tab-separated files, one table per dataset.

Please add your metadata by following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/): clone the repository, add one or more row(s) to the appropriate table(s), and create a pull request.
We will review your pull request (and your files on zenodo) as soon as possible, and ask question - if needed.

**Thank you for your contribution!**
