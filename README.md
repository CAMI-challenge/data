# CAMI data
Pointers to publicly available assembly, binning, and profiling results (with structured metadata).


## Step 1: Upload your results

Submit your results to zenodo's CAMI Community - [https://zenodo.org/communities/cami](https://zenodo.org/communities/cami) -, click on **New upload**.

Drag and drop your result files or **Choose files**.

Click on **Start upload** (this might take a while).

A checkmark (under *Progress*) indicates that the upload was successful.

As the *Upload type*, select *Dataset* and enter *Title*, *Authors*, and brief *Description* (you will provide structured metadata in Step 2).

## Step 2: Provide structured metadata

Metadata and links to the raw data are stored in this repository in tab-separated files, one table per dataset (e.g. [CAMI2/Toy/MouseGut/assembly.tsv](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/data/blob/master/CAMI2/Toy/MouseGut/assembly.tsv)).
Please add your metadata by following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/): clone the repository, add one or more row(s) to the appropriate table(s), and create a pull request.
We will review your pull request (and your files on zenodo) as soon as possible, and ask question - if needed.

**Thank you for your contribution!**
