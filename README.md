# CAMI data
Pointers to publicly available assembly, binning, and profiling results (with structured metadata).

# Upload your results using upload tool (recommended way)

## Step 1: Copy the CAMI-challenge/data repository

* Fork (i.e. make a copy of) the data repository to your GitHub account [here](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/data/fork).

* Get a local copy of the forked repository on your computer:
~~~BASH
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/data.git
~~~

* To be able to pull changes from the original repository, add the original data repo as an upstream remote:
~~~BASH
cd data
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/data.git
~~~

## Step 2: Provide the metadata for your results

* Make sure that the master branch is up to date with the original data repository:
~~~BASH
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master
~~~

* Create and checkout a new branch for your work:
~~~BASH
git checkout -b update_metadata
~~~

* Enter the matadata in the tab-separated tables, e.g. in [data/CAMI2/toy/mouse_gut/taxonomic_profiling.tsv](data/CAMI2/toy/mouse_gut/taxonomic_profiling.tsv). As your results will still be uploaded and do not yet have a DOI, enter the word `new` in the DOI column.\
You may also create new directories and tsv files. Every directory with tsv files must contain a `description.txt` with the title of the respective CAMI data set. The upload tool will scan every subdirectory in the data repository for tsv files listed in the [tasks.tsv](tasks.tsv). 

Notes about the table columns:

In column `SamplesUsed`, provide the numbers identifying the samples used. If multiple samples were used, you can provide ranges, e.g. 0-63, and specific samples, e.g. 0-63,70,75.

Multiple files can be provided in the `FileName` column by separating them with semi-colons, e.g. file1;file2;file3.

Similarly, multiple creators, ORCIDs, and affiliations can be provided with semi-colons in columns `Creator`, `ORCID`, and `Affiliation`.
 

## Step 3: Upload your results to Zenodo

* In your Zenodo account settings, go to [Applications](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/) and create a personal access token with `deposit:write` permission. You may also activate the `deposit:actions` permission, or leave it deactivated to avoid accidentally publishing results. Once the token is created, store it safely!


* Upload your files using the upload tool (requires Python 3):

~~~BASH
./zenodo_upload.py -h
usage: zenodo_upload.py [-h] [--github_dir GITHUB_DIR] --files_dir FILES_DIR
                        --zenodo_token ZENODO_TOKEN [--sandbox]                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
CAMI Zenodo upload tool                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
optional arguments:                                                                                                                                                                                               
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit                                                                                                                                                           
  --github_dir GITHUB_DIR                                                                                                                                                                                         
                        GitHub directory [default: current working directory]                                                                                                                                     
  --files_dir FILES_DIR                                                                                                                                                                                           
                        Directory containing files to be uploaded                                                                                                                                                 
  --zenodo_token ZENODO_TOKEN                                                                                                                                                                                     
                        Zenodo access token
~~~

Example:
~~~BASH
./zenodo_upload.py --files_dir /home/me/myresults/ --zenodo_token xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
~~~

`--files_dir` is the path to the files of results that are being uploaded. It should be different from `--github_dir`, as those files are not supposed to be uploaded to GitHub. 

`--zenodo_token` is the token that you generated, as described above.


## Step 4: Publish the uploaded results

WARNING: ONCE YOUR RESULTS ARE PUBLISHED, THEY CANNOT BE DELETED!

* To publish your results, you can either go to your [list of uploads](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/deposit) on the Zenodo website, select an upload, make final changes if needed, and then publish it by clicking on the publish button.

* Alternatively, you can use the publish tool:

~~~BASH
./zenodo_publish.py -h
usage: zenodo_publish.py [-h] --zenodo_token ZENODO_TOKEN [--sandbox] logfile

CAMI Zenodo publish tool

positional arguments:
  logfile               Log file containing deposition IDs

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --zenodo_token ZENODO_TOKEN
                        Zenodo access token
  --sandbox             Sandbox test
~~~

The `logfile`, called `zenodo_deposits_DATE_TIME.log` is automatically created by the upload tool in the working directory, where `DATE_TIME` are the date and time of the upload.


## Step 5: Update metadata tables with DOIs and create pull request 

* Update the metadata tables by replacing the word `new` with the generated DOIs.

* Choose the edited files to commit, e.g. data/CAMI2/toy/mouse_gut/taxonomic_profiling.tsv:
~~~BASH
git add data/CAMI2/toy/mouse_gut/taxonomic_profiling.tsv
~~~

* Commit the changes with a sensible message:
~~~BASH
git commit -m "add results for tool x"
~~~

* Push your commit to GitHub:
~~~BASH
git push
~~~

* Create a pull request on GitHub for your forked data repository to the original repository (see [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)).

![foo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CAMI-challenge/data/master/_tutorial/z11.png)


## Step 2: Provide structured metadata

Metadata and links to the raw data are stored in this repository in tab-separated files, one table per dataset (e.g. [CAMI2/Toy/MouseGut/assembly.tsv](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/data/blob/master/CAMI2/Toy/MouseGut/assembly.tsv)).

Please add your metadata by following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/): clone the repository, add one or more row(s) to the appropriate table(s), and create a pull request.
We will review your pull request (and your files on zenodo) as soon as possible, and ask question - if needed.

**Thank you for your contribution!**
